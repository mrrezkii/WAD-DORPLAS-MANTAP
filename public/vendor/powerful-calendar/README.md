**DOCS**

**Very basic styling included. It is totally upto you to style it.**
(*Of course, so that there is almost no conflict with your own styles. The CSS is put mostly for reference*)

To initialize it, include jQuery and the calendar.js script file in your HTML.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2.1/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wrick17/calendar-plugin@master/calendar.min.js"></script>
```

And the CSS for the default styles

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wrick17/calendar-plugin@master/style.css">
```

Add the included theme (or your own) for some extra flair

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wrick17/calendar-plugin@master/theme.css">
```

Then call the calendar function on the element inside which you want your calendar pugin to put itself

```
$('.calendar-wrapper').calendar();
```

To use the optional features pass the parameters as options:

```
$('.calendar-wrapper').calendar({
  date: '05/21/2017',
  enableMonthChange: false
});
```

**And you should be up and running. Most of the code is pretty self explanatory.**

To update it, call the updateCalendarOptions function

```
$('.calendar-wrapper').updateCalendarOptions({
  date: '05/11/2017'
});
```

Default options go as below:

```
var options = {
  date: null,
  weekDayLength: 1,
  prevButton: 'Prev',
  nextButton: 'Next',
  monthYearSeparator: ' ',
  onClickDate: function(date){},
  onChangeMonth: function(date){},
  onClickToday: function(date){},
  onClickMonthNext: function(date){},
  onClickMonthPrev: function(date){},
  onClickYearNext: function(date){},
  onClickYearPrev: function(date){},
  onShowYearView: function(date){},
  onSelectYear: function(date){},
  showThreeMonthsInARow: true,
  enableMonthChange: true,
  enableYearView: true,
  showTodayButton: true,
  highlightSelectedWeekday: true,
  highlightSelectedWeek: true,
  todayButtonContent: 'Today',
  showYearDropdown: false,
  min: null,
